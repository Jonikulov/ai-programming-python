## Image Classification for a City Dog Show

### Description
For this image classification task, we will be using an image classification application using a deep learning model called a **convolutional neural network** (often abbreviated as **CNN**). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images. We'll use a CNN that has already learned the features from a giant dataset of 1.2 million images called [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/). There are different types of CNNs that have different structures (architectures) that work better or worse depending on our criteria. With this project, we'll explore the three different architectures (**AlexNet**, **VGG**, and **ResNet**) and determine which is best for our application.
