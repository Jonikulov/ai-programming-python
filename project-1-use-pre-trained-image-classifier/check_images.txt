Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified the dog breed in Dog_01.jpg as the same breed. The result: "eskimo dog, husky".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: ALEXNET and RESNET model architectures had the same classification, but VGG architecture was wrong. The VGG model's incorrect dog assignment was "llama".


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures classified Tiger_01.jpg and Rubics_Cube_01.jpg as not being dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on classification results, the best model architecture at classifying the four uploaded images is ResNet. The accuracy of ResNet was higher than the other two models in all statistical percentages.
